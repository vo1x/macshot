</p>

A native macOS screenshot tool inspired by [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/). No Electron, no Qt, no bloat — built with Swift and AppKit.

macshot lives in your menu bar and lets you capture, annotate, and share screenshots with a single hotkey.

## Features

- **Scroll capture** — select a region and scroll normally; macshot stitches each strip into one seamless tall image using Apple Vision for pixel-perfect alignment; works at any speed, handles upward and downward scrolling
- **Screen recording** — record any region as MP4 (H.264) or GIF; interact with apps normally while recording, or toggle annotation mode to draw on the live screen; recordings saved to your configured folder
- **Instant capture** — global hotkey (default: `Cmd+Shift+X`) freezes your screen and lets you select a region
- **Editor window** — open any capture in a standalone resizable editor window with a top bar showing pixel dimensions, crop, flip H/V, and zoom level; annotate, crop, copy, save, pin, or upload without dismissing the overlay
- **Crop tool** — editor window only; drag a rectangle (with rule-of-thirds grid) to crop the image in place, annotations translate automatically; fully undoable
- **Flip image** — flip horizontally or vertically in the editor; annotations are mirrored to match; fully undoable
- **Auto-measure** — with the measure tool, hold `1` for automatic vertical or `2` for horizontal measurement; scans pixels outward from cursor until color changes
- **Window snap** — hover over any window to highlight it with a blue border and click to snap to it; `Tab` toggles snap mode, `F` captures full screen
- **Live QR & barcode detection** — automatically detects QR codes and barcodes in the selected area; shows an inline bar to open URLs or copy the payload
- **Annotation tools** — arrow, line, rectangle, filled rectangle, ellipse, pencil (with optional smooth strokes), marker/highlighter, text, numbered markers (with optional pointer cone), pixelate, Gaussian blur
- **Color opacity** — drag the opacity slider in the color picker to set transparency for all drawing tools; marker keeps its own highlight opacity
- **Hover-to-move** — hover over any annotation with a drawing tool active to instantly drag, resize, or delete it without switching to the Select tool
- **Rich text** — bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, adjustable font size; `Enter` inserts a new line; confirm with ✓ button
- **Translation** — translate extracted OCR text to any language directly in the OCR results window
- **Shift-constrain** — hold Shift while drawing for straight lines, perfect circles, and squares
- **Auto-redact PII** — one-click detection and redaction of emails, phone numbers, credit cards, SSNs, API keys, and more; uses blur or pixelate style matching the active tool
- **Snap alignment guides** — annotations snap to selection midlines and existing annotation edges with cyan guide lines (toggleable in Preferences)
- **Delay capture** — set a 3/5/10 second timer to capture tooltips, menus, and hover states
- **Secure redaction** — pixelate tool is irreversible (multi-pass downscale, not a reversible blur)
- **Color picker** — 12 preset colors, one click to switch
- **Undo/Redo** — `Cmd+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z`
- **OCR text extraction** — extract text from any selected area using Apple Vision, with copy, search, and translation
- **Beautify mode** — wrap screenshots in a macOS window frame with traffic lights, shadow, and gradient background (6 styles)
- **Background removal** — remove the background from any selection using Apple Vision (macOS 14+)
- **Pin to screen** — pin a screenshot as a floating always-on-top window, movable and resizable; open in editor with the pencil button
- **Floating thumbnail** — thumbnail slides in after capture with Copy/Save/Pin/Edit/Upload action buttons on hover; multiple thumbnails stack vertically; configurable auto-dismiss delay (toggleable)
- **Screenshot history** — re-copy recent captures from the menu bar "Recent Captures" submenu (configurable, in-memory)
- **Upload to imgbb** — one-click upload; view and copy upload/delete URLs in Preferences → Uploads
- **Pixel dimensions** — always-visible size label above the selection, click to type an exact resolution
- **Quick save** — right-click a window (snap mode) or drag to instantly save to your configured folder
- **Output formats** — PNG (lossless), JPEG, HEIC, and WebP with configurable quality; optional Retina downscale to 1x; sRGB color profile embedding
- **Output options** — copy to clipboard (`Cmd+C`), save to file (`Cmd+S`)
- **Multi-monitor support** — captures all screens simultaneously
- **Configurable hotkey** — change it in Preferences
- **Automatic updates** — built-in update checking via [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/); checks every 30 minutes or manually from the menu bar
- **WebP encoding** — powered by [Swift-WebP](https://github.com/ainame/Swift-WebP) (libwebp wrapper)
- **Lightweight** — ~8 MB memory at idle, menu bar only (no dock icon)
