# Changelog

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Text Tool Overhaul**: Replaced basic text entry with an auto-resizing native text field that is single-line by default. Added `Shift+Enter` for multiline support.
- **Context Menus**: Added context menu support for toolbar tools. Right-click on drawing tools (pencil, line, etc.) or the beautify button to access their settings (stroke, color, or beautify styles), indicated by a small corner triangle.

### Improved
- **Square Selection Constrain**: Holding `Shift` while selecting an area now correctly constrains the selection to a perfect square.
- **Icon Updates**: Replaced the text tool icon with a cleaner `textformat` symbol. Also improved the main menu bar app icon with a larger scale.
- **UI Polish**: Vertically aligned the font size label with the +/- buttons for better aesthetics.
- **Marker Adjustments**: Fine-tuned the marker tool thickness and fixed text crop block sizing.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Blur/Pixelate stacking**: Blurring or pixelating an already-blurred area now correctly operates on the composited image (including previous annotations) instead of the raw screenshot. Re-blurring now properly increases the blur effect instead of partially reverting it.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Right-click color wheel**: Right-click inside the selection while drawing to open a radial color picker centered on the cursor. Drag toward a color to select it, release to confirm. 12 preset colors arranged in a ring.
- **Middle-click move toggle**: Middle mouse button toggles Move Object mode on/off for quick access without clicking the toolbar.
- **Move Object cursor**: Open hand cursor when in Move Object mode instead of crosshair.

### Changed
- Move Object button moved to leftmost position in the toolbar with a subtle background tint to visually distinguish it from drawing tools.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Move Object tool**: Select and reposition existing annotations. Click to select, drag to move. Works with lines, arrows, rectangles, ellipses, pencil, marker, text, numbers, and measure lines. Button only appears when there are movable annotations. Pixelate and blur are excluded (position-dependent).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Upload to cloud**: Upload screenshots to imgbb with one click. Link auto-copied to clipboard, toast shows clickable link + delete button. Configurable API key in Preferences.
- **Measure tool**: Pixel ruler for measuring distances. Drag to measure, shows pixel dimensions with a label. Hold Shift to snap to horizontal, vertical, or 45° angles. Shows width × height breakdown for diagonal measurements.
- **Colored beautify style icon**: The style picker icon now matches the selected gradient theme color for quick visual identification.

### Changed
- Beautify mode and style now persist across sessions (remembered after toggling).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Full-screen capture via single click**: Left-click without dragging instantly selects the entire screen for annotation. Right-click without dragging performs a quick save/copy of the full screen.
- **Smart toolbar placement**: Toolbars now independently detect when they would go off-screen and move inside the selection. Works for any selection shape — full-width, full-height, or full-screen — not just full-screen rectangles.
- **Draggable toolbars**: Drag toolbar backgrounds to reposition them so they don't block areas you want to annotate.

### Changed
- Updated helper text to reflect single-click full-screen shortcuts.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Image format setting**: Choose between PNG (lossless, default) and JPEG with adjustable quality slider (10–100%) in Preferences. Applies to clipboard copy, file save, quick save, and screenshot history.
- **Disk-based screenshot history**: Recent captures are now stored as files in `~/Library/Application Support/com.sw33tlie.macshot/history/` instead of in memory. Zero RAM overhead, persists across restarts, and directory is created with owner-only permissions (0700).

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Memory usage**: Screenshot history now stores compressed PNG data instead of raw bitmaps, reducing memory from ~400 MB to ~30-50 MB with 10 entries. Floating thumbnail controller is also released after auto-dismiss instead of holding the full-res image until the next capture.
- **Color picker cursor**: Arrow cursor now shown over the color picker popup instead of crosshair.
- **Color picker indicator**: HSB gradient crosshair ring now tracks the actual mouse position accurately.
- **Selection visibility**: Fixed remaining case where the "Release to annotate" helper text disappeared at 1px selection dimensions.

## [1.2.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Color picker cursor**: The cursor now switches to an arrow over the color picker popup (presets and HSB gradient) instead of staying as a crosshair.
- **Color picker indicator**: The crosshair ring on the HSB gradient now tracks the actual mouse position instead of reverse-computing from the selected color, which caused drift due to color space conversions.

## [1.2.5] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Selection drawing**: Fixed remaining cases where the selection region and "Release to annotate" helper text would disappear when width or height was exactly 1px during drag.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Color picker positioning**: The color picker popup now flips above the toolbar when it would go off the bottom of the screen, and clamps horizontally to stay within display bounds.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Color picker**: Replaced the external system color panel with an inline HSB gradient picker. Click the rainbow "+" swatch to expand a hue-saturation gradient and brightness slider directly inside the toolbar popup — no separate window, no losing focus.

### Fixed
- **Selection drawing**: The overlay no longer disappears when the selection width or height is momentarily zero while dragging. The selection region stays visible throughout the entire drag.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Color picker**: Expanded from 12 to 23 preset colors in a 6-column grid, with extra shades and grayscale options. Added a rainbow "+" swatch that opens the macOS system color panel for picking any custom color.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Auto-Redact**: Much better credit card detection — now catches card numbers split across separate lines (e.g. "4868 7191 9682 9038" displayed as four groups), CVV codes, and expiry dates. Multi-pass detection with context awareness.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Auto-Redact**: One-click PII detection and redaction. Scans the selected region for emails, phone numbers, credit cards, SSNs, IP addresses, API keys, bearer tokens, and secrets — then covers each match with a filled rectangle. Fully undoable (Cmd+Z removes all redactions at once).
- **Delay Capture**: Timer button in the right toolbar lets you dismiss the overlay and re-capture after 3, 5, or 10 seconds — perfect for capturing tooltips, menus, and hover states. The selection region is preserved. Click to cycle through delays.
- **Right-click mode toggle**: New "Right-click action" setting in Preferences — choose between "Save to file" (default) or "Copy to clipboard".

### Fixed
- **Toolbar overlap**: Right toolbar no longer overlaps with the bottom toolbar when drawing narrow selections.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Right-click mode toggle**: New "Right-click action" setting in Preferences — choose between "Save to file" (default) or "Copy to clipboard". Helper text on the capture screen updates to reflect the selected mode.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Right-click quick save**: Right-click and drag to select a region and instantly save it as a PNG — no toolbar, no annotations, just a fast screenshot to disk. File is saved with the format `Screenshot 2026-03-11 at 16.09.19.png`.
- **Helper text on capture**: On-screen hints guide new users — idle screen shows left-click vs right-click instructions, and while dragging shows what happens on release (annotate or save to folder).
- **Configurable save folder**: Default save directory changed from Desktop to Pictures. Configurable in Preferences and used by both the Save button and right-click quick save.

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor**: Reliably forces the crosshair cursor on capture start, even when no window was focused.
- **Pixelate block size**: Pixelation blocks are now a fixed size regardless of selection area.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor**: Reliably forces the crosshair cursor on capture start, even when no window was focused. Previous fix in v1.0.6 was insufficient.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Crosshair cursor**: The cursor now immediately switches to a crosshair when capture starts. Previously it could stay as a normal pointer until the mouse moved, especially when triggered via hotkey.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Pixelate block size**: Pixelation blocks are now a fixed size regardless of selection area, so redactions look consistent whether you select a small or large region.
- **Beautify tooltip**: Clarified the Beautify button tooltip so users understand what it does at a glance.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Blur Tool**: Real Gaussian blur annotation tool (next to Pixelate in the toolbar). Drag to select a region, blur is applied on release. Uses CIGaussianBlur with edge clamping for clean results.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Beautify Mode**: Wrap screenshots in a macOS-style window frame with traffic light buttons, drop shadow, and gradient background. Toggle with the sparkles button in the toolbar, cycle through 6 gradient styles (Ocean, Sunset, Forest, Midnight, Candy, Snow). Applied on copy, save, and pin — OCR always uses the raw image.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Screenshot History**: Recent captures are kept in memory and accessible from the "Recent Captures" submenu in the menu bar. Click any entry to re-copy it to clipboard. Configurable size (0–50, default 10). Set to 0 to disable.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **OCR Text Extraction**: New toolbar button to extract text from the selected area using Apple Vision framework. Results appear in a floating panel with copy, search, and word/character count.
- **Pin to Screen**: Pin any screenshot selection as a floating always-on-top window. Movable, resizable, with right-click context menu (Copy, Save, Close). Press Escape to dismiss.
- **Floating Thumbnail**: After capture, a thumbnail slides in from the bottom-right (like macOS native). Click to dismiss, drag to drop as a PNG file into any app. Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds. Toggleable in Preferences.
- **Capture Sound**: Plays the macOS screenshot sound on copy/save. Toggleable in Preferences.
- **Pixel Dimensions Label**: Selection dimensions (in pixels) shown above/below the selection at all times. Click to type an exact resolution (e.g. "1920x1080") and resize the selection.

### Changed
- Removed the size display toolbar button (replaced by the always-visible pixel dimensions label above the selection)
- Preferences window now includes toggles for capture sound and floating thumbnail
- Added "Made by sw33tLie" attribution with GitHub link in Preferences
